# Map Reduce - Python

## About
MapReduce is a programming paradigm that allows for massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a cluster environment.

The term MapReduce originated from functional programming and was introduced by Google in a paper called “MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters.”

- Simply put, MapReduce is about scalability.
- Using the MapReduce paradigm, you focus on writing two functions
  - map() → Filters and aggregates data
  - reduce() → Reduces, groups, and summarizes by keys generated by map()
