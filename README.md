# Map Reduce - Python

## About
MapReduce is a programming paradigm that allows for massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a cluster environment

The term MapReduce originated from functional programming and was introduced by Google in a paper called “MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters.”

- Simply put, MapReduce is about scalability
- Using the MapReduce paradigm, you focus on writing two functions
  - map() → Filters and aggregates data
  - reduce() → Reduces, groups, and summarizes by keys generated by map()

### Map Function
The master node takes the input, partitions it into smaller data chunks, and distributes them to worker (slave) nodes  

The worker nodes apply the same transformation function to each data chunk, then pass the results back to the master node.

> map(): (Key1, Value1) → [(Key2, Value2)]

### Reduce Function
The master node shuffles and clusters the received results based on unique key-value pairs

Then, through another redistribution to the workers/slaves, these values are combined via another type of transformation function

> reduce(): (Key2, [Value2]) → [(Key3, Value3)]

## Example
Let’s say that we want to count the number of books in a library that has 1,000 shelves and report the final result to the librarian.

- Solution #1 (using map() and reduce()):
  - map(): Hire 1,000 workers; each worker counts one shelf
  - reduce(): All workers get together and add up their individual counts

- Solution #2 (using map(), combine(), and reduce()):  
  - map(): Hire 1,110 workers (1,000 workers, 100 managers, 10 supervisors—each supervisor manages 10 managers, and each manager manages 10 workers); each worker counts one shelf, and reports its count to its manager
  - combine(): Every 10 managers add up their individual counts and report the total to a supervisor
  - reduce(): All supervisors get together and add up their individual counts (by reporting the results to the librarian)
